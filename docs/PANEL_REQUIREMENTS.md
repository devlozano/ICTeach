# Panel requirement integration and testing

Updated 6 September 2026. These are application integrations, not a claim of production acceptance or TESDA certification.

## Teacher/trainer setup (required before student testing)

1. Publish the actual lessons and nonempty terminology/theory quizzes using the existing module/quiz CMS.
2. Open a class → Modules → **Lesson & assessment links** (branching-path icon).
3. Select each simulation and link its relevant published lesson and a teacher/trainer theory quiz. Configure standalone quizzes too. Simulations are fixed scenarios, not editable quiz questions.
4. Review each link against the instructional module. A link establishes the app prerequisite; a teacher must verify curricular accuracy. An existing theory quiz's lesson link is preserved when reused.
5. Unlock appropriate content through Content Lock Settings.

Unconfigured activities intentionally show a setup message instead of allowing students to bypass learning. Existing grades and simulation passes are preserved; new practice is kept separately.

## Requirement map

| Panel item | Integrated behavior / location |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Advanced learning | Existing OS installation, software configuration, maintenance, hardware repair and network-diagnostic scenarios now support explicit lesson/quiz links. These are interactive virtual procedural exercises, not a real operating-system installer or packet emulator. |
| 2. Clear user roles | Help icon in student home and class detail describes administrator, teacher/adviser, trainer and student responsibilities. |
| 3. Trainer and teaching difficulty | Existing trainer dashboard/CMS plus built-in Teaching & learning check-in under Questionnaires & Evaluations. Ratings explicitly distinguish clarity from difficulty; responses identify the student and class teacher. |
| 4. Knowledge before activity | The linked published module must be marked complete before practice or assessment. Existing diagnostic gate remains on module entry. This records study completion, not proof of comprehension. |
| 5. Two-part assessment and practice | Separate ungraded quiz/simulation practice; linked theory quiz before scored simulation; practice never writes quiz_results, simulation_progress or completed_content. Theory completion, not a passing grade, opens the simulation stage. Quiz retakes remain prohibited. |
| 5c. Informative feedback | Simulation feedback retains corrected resource, sequence and compatibility mistakes. RJ45 results include possible open/short/miswire/split-pair causes and distinguish physical wiring from IP/VLAN issues. These are educational possibilities, not diagnoses of physical equipment. |
| 6. Quiz CMS | Existing teacher/trainer Create/Edit/Publish/Delete quiz pages remain the authoring source. The learning-path manager references these quizzes without exposing simulation editing. |
| 7. Monitoring | Class Insights → history icon shows newly recorded lesson opening/completion, practice completion and scored quiz/simulation completion; simulation mistakes are expandable. Existing grades/progress/feedback reports remain available. No keystroke or background surveillance. |
| 8. School years | Existing Admin Settings academic-year rollover archives without deletion. Student dashboard resolves authoritative class status, ignores archived memberships and allows joining a new active class. Archived class detail directs staff to historical reports; new assessment/practice and lesson-progress saves are blocked. |
| 9. Final system evaluation | Completing a module offers an Evaluate action; Questionnaires & Evaluations also exposes the form. It opens only after all published lessons are marked complete. Usability, usefulness, reliability and improvement comments appear in Class Insights Feedback. |

## Manual acceptance checklist

Automated verification: 22 tests passed; static analysis has no errors/warnings (324 informational findings). The automated suite does not replace the following multi-account checks.

- Use separate admin, teacher, trainer and student test accounts in an authorized test class.
- Verify unmapped activity, missing lesson, missing practice and missing theory each block the appropriate next stage.
- Complete diagnostic and linked lesson. Complete quiz practice and inspect answer explanations. Confirm no grade exists yet.
- Complete the scored theory quiz once. Confirm duplicate submission cannot overwrite it.
- Complete simulation practice, then simulation assessment. Verify only assessment affects grades/progress; check the timeline and corrected-error history.
- Make deliberate RJ45 resource/sequence/placement mistakes and inspect feedback on a small screen.
- Submit teaching feedback; verify staff can see the named student, individual rating prompts/values and full comment.
- Verify system evaluation is blocked with unfinished lessons, then available after the final published lesson.
- In a test class, archive the old year and join a current-year class without deleting historical membership or results. Verify the dashboard selects the active class.
- Test reconnect/retry, content locking while open, and changes to lesson links during a session.

## Data and release limitations

- New collections: `classes/{classId}/learning_paths`, `users/{uid}/practice_progress`, top-level `activity_events`. Existing `questionnaire_responses` stores built-in evaluations.
- Activity history starts with this update; old activity timestamps are not fabricated. Opening practice/assessment sessions is also recorded, but is not evidence of completion. Feedback is identified, not anonymous.
- Lesson/practice/theory and active-class checks are revalidated before saving assessments. They are client-side checks, not backend authorization or tamper-proof scoring.
- Previously inspected live Firestore rules permit every signed-in user to read/write broadly. Production release requires reviewed role/membership rules, protected grades and role fields, rules tests, and privacy review for student feedback. No live rules or production deployment were changed for this integration.
- Full archived-data immutability requires those backend rules; existing legacy mutation paths are not a secure archive boundary.
- Real-account acceptance, Cloudinary uploads and Hostinger deployment must still be verified. Do not label the project 100% accepted based on a local build alone.
